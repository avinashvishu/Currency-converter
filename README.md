# Currency Converter Website

The Currency Converter Website is a user-friendly and interactive online tool designed to facilitate quick and accurate currency conversion. With this website, users can effortlessly convert an amount from one currency to another, gaining insights into the equivalent values across various countries' currencies.

## How It Works:

1. Input: Users enter a specific quantity in the "Choose a Quantity" section.
2. Currency Selection: Users select the currency from which they wish to convert.
3. Conversion: Upon submission, the website fetches real-time exchange rate data using the app.currencyapi.com API.
4. Results Table: The website then displays a comprehensive table illustrating the entered quantity's equivalent value in different countries' currencies.
